  ## Description
  A database created with Object Relational Mapping code which serves as a backend database for the frontend user when searching for products on a fullstack website. The project details the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes.

  ## Installation
  After cloning the repo to your local machine, NPM Express must be installed along with Sequelize and MySQL2 packages as these are the required dependencies. 

  ## Usage
  Using the commandline, login to your MySQL database from the root folder after creating(and installing) DotENV via NPM. Source db/schema.sql will bring up the Ecommerce_db database, then Use ecommerce_db and exit. Make sure to use ';' at the end of the previous commandline code as it will not access the database. After exiting MySQL, NPM run seed will sync the database and then NPM run start to run the 3001 server port. Insomnia is recommended to run the tests for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
